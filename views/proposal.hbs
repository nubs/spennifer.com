    <p>It happened on a Saturday night--Saturday, October 21, 2006 to be exact. When Jennifer woke up that morning she knew that she was going to an Aerosmith/Motley Crue concert that evening with Spencer. She had, after all, bought the tickets. What she didn't know is that she wouldn't be going to Warrior's Mongolian Barbeque for dinner, as was planned, but to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meltingpot.com/">Melting Pot Fondue Restaurant</a>. After she found out about the new plans, she spent the rest of the day in patient suspense wondering "Is tonight the night?". The dinner was terrific (it is fondue after all), but as the last bites of dessert were taken no moves had been made. Jennifer commented that dinner was wonderful. To which, Spencer replied "Yeah, it was...but it's not over yet." After that, a little bit more was said, which neither Spencer nor Jennifer can remember (although it must've worked), and Spencer got up, knelt down on one knee, pulled the ring out of his jacket pocket and proposed. Jennifer said yes and the rest of the evening went splendidly, even if Steven Tyler didn't end up singing their song, "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."</p>
    <p>As for the ring, Spencer and Jennifer decided to go ring shopping together before she went back to school for the fall. They did their homework and learned all about the four C's. When they came across information on diamond shapes, they both decided that they wanted the sparkle of a round diamond but the look of a princess. Low and behold they found exactly what they wanted in the cushion- or pillow-cut diamond. (Cushion-cut diamonds have rounded corners and larger facets to increase their brilliance.) Once Spencer and Jennifer knew what they wanted, they headed to the jewelry stores. They stopped and looked at over ten different places but in the end only three even knew what a cushion-cut diamond was and only Jared's had one on hand. Spencer later returned without Jenny and spent an afternoon browsing their online catalog until he found the perfect diamond. Three days later he went back to take a look before they mounted it, and the next day he was taking the finished ring home. He ended up having the ring for a couple of weeks, showing it off to friends and family, before the time was right.</p>
