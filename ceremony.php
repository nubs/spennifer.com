		<td colspan="3">The ceremony will be held at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greatbridgeumc.org">Great Bridge United Methodist Church</a>, Spencer and Jennifer's home church in Chesapeake, Virginia.  The Rineharts and the McClures have been active members of GBUMC for quite some time and could not have asked for a better church family.  Jennifer has worked as the part-time secretary for three summers, and during that time developed a close bond with the church staff.  Consequently, there are no two people Spencer and Jennifer would rather have perform the ceremony than Rev. Kesner.</td>
