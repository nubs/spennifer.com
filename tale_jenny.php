			<p>Jennifer was born in Washington, D.C. on January 12, 1985 to Allan and Dale McClure. Being an Army brat (Go Army!) her family moved around quite a bit during her early years. Although she has lived in different parts of both Germany and Virginia, she calls Chesapeake home. Jennifer graduated from Great Bridge High School in 2003 and started college at Virginia Tech that fall. She entered VT's five-year Master's program in Teaching and Learning and will graduate with her Bachelor's in December 2006. After graduation, Jennifer will return to Virginia Tech to start working on her Master's degree and will finally be done with school in May of 2008. In her spare time, Jennifer enjoys singing &amp; ringing in her Church Chancel &amp; Handbell choirs, teaching Sunday school, watching movies, playing games (and beating Spencer), hiking, playing soccer, and spending quality time with her fiance.</p>
